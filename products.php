    <p><strong>Review:&nbsp;</strong>lenovo is quite tricky quick start platform is a software platform (seperate from windows7) that helps you quickly access some key features like web surfing and playing media, and havent faced any issue about performance. BUT if you want to play NFS or Arkham Asylum, this is not the system for you. Buy an i3 or i5 with a graphics card instead. ultra small : the overall size is compact and this adds to the portability feature</p>

The two bigger models are available in four alluring colors, while the most compact model comes in two.

You can enjoy further with the realism portrayed by the Aspire V5 Series.I like the designs very simple and elegant,..the speaker is good very loud.The processor is fast but sometimes when connection is too slow i cant connect internet.Battery life storage is not good.. 
user friendly and very portable you can carry anywhere, because its thin and light.</p>

Notebook, 11.6inch, AMD, C-70, 1GHz Dual-core, 4GB, 320GB
    <p><strong>Review:&nbsp;</strong>This Laptop has an excellent build quality. The laptop’s black plastic bottom and bezel hide panel gaps from sight. Users will have to look closely to spot them, and they’re small once discovered. It is also portable and easy to use .the camera is very clear.

But the Sound quality is extremely poor.it has small speakers struggle at maximum volume, which isn’t loud, resulting in significant distortion even in tracks that don’t pump up the bass. Lowering the volume solves the distortion but makes the laptop too quiet..and also the battery usage is easily drain ..It should be connected to charger while using it.</p>

The quality is good for having its dual core AMD processor,plus AMD Radeon HD8570M graphics processor..,which able to provide a great graphics for full movies.It also have 5400 revolution power meter,500GB hard drive size and its 2GB memory storage which can be expanded using its PC card slot for (SD,SDHC ,SDXC) multi media reader.

It also a plus for me that it had webcam,HDMI,bluetooth,USB2.0 ,super multi-dual layer optical drive..</p>

    <p><strong>Review:&nbsp;</strong>The Dell Inspiron 14z thins down the bulky look of the average Inspiron laptop while sacrificing none of the performance or battery life, adding up to an affordable mainstream notebook that's an excellent late consideration.

The 14-inch glossy display has a native resolution of 1,366x768 pixels. The screen brightness and colors were fuller than we expected, making movies and TV shows pop. Viewing at angles eventually caused the picture to wash out, but no more than on most average laptop screens.</p>

This laptop is good in terms of its portability and the graphics is awesome and its sound because it is dolby digital.
<br>[Bad]<br> 
Bad side of this laptop is the processor because it is only pentium dual core processor. I also don't like that the Fn key must be pressed first to activation the function keys(F1-F12) because if I accidentally pressed the F4 key without pressing the 'Fn', the current open application will be closed because it is the shortcut key for closing the application or program.</p>

    <p><strong>Review:&nbsp;</strong>Itong machine na toh eh simpleng simple lang yung design. Halos hindi makagawa ng modifications. Pero pasok kasi sa consumer's aesthetic yung pagka black na body color niya at ok naman ang built -in design nito,. Tapos may stripe texture layout pa siya. Very practical lang yung design niya. Pero yung cover eh madaling malagyan ng fingerprints pero may anti-scrath ability naman siya.Meron din itong large memory na kayang maghandle ng mabibigat na files and media,para hindi bumagal ang run ng proocessor.</p>
